## 🛠️ What I Do  

- **Cybersecurity**: Network analysis, penetration testing, Wi-Fi security exploitation (including Wi-Fi 6), and securing digital systems (more details on my [TryHackMe profile](https://tryhackme.com/p/Roko).  
- **Software Development**: Full-stack **AI** applications with **TypeScript**, **Python**, **C++/C#** (examples in my public repositories).  
  - Creator of JobUnblocker — a microservices-based AI platform for automated job matching.
Built with Redis, Prometheus, Grafana, and Tilt, with resilience mechanisms (failover, monitoring) and infrastructure prepared for Kubernetes deployment. (https://app.jobunblock.com)
  - Creator of **ChipTree** — a platform for real-time data fetching from IoT sensors with automated firmware updates over Wi-Fi. (https://chiptree.pl)  
- **Hardware & IoT**:  
  - Designed and built both the **application and hardware** for a **mobile-controlled device (iOS & Android)** managing **42 vibrating motors**, powered by a rechargeable battery.  
  - Created an **ESP-12-based device** with **OTA (Over-The-Air) firmware updates via Wi-Fi**, a web-based control interface, and an ultra-low-power hardware design powered by a **single AA battery**.  
  - PCB design and prototyping using **KiCad**, **LTSpice**, **Falstad**, **EasyEDA**.  
  - Certified to work on electrical systems up to 1000V (SEP license – Poland).
